# Swift Programming Problems

1. **Train Ticket Price Checker**  
   A railway company charges different ticket prices based on age:

   - Children under 12: 5 EUR
   - Adults (12–59): 10 EUR
   - Seniors (60 and above): 7 EUR
   
   Create a program that asks for a person's age and displays the appropriate ticket price.

2. **Shopping Discount Calculator**  
   A customer buys 3 items. If the **total cost is over 100 EUR**, they get a **15% discount**.
   
   Create a program that takes the price of each item, calculates the total, applies the discount if needed, and shows the final amount to pay.

3. **What to Wear Today?**  
   Based on the temperature in Celsius:

   - Below 10°C: "Wear a heavy jacket"
   - 10–20°C: "Wear a sweater"
   - 21–30°C: "Wear a t-shirt"
   - Above 30°C: "Stay cool and wear light clothes"

   Create a program that asks for the temperature and gives a clothing suggestion.

4. **Student Grade Evaluator**  
   A student receives a test score (0–100). Based on the score:

   - 90–100: "Excellent"
   - 75–89: "Good"
   - 50–74: "Fair"
   - Below 50: "Fail"
   
   Write a program that asks for the score and displays the result category.

5. **Weekly Step Counter**  
   A person logs the number of steps walked each day for 7 days.

   - If total steps ≥ 70,000: "Great job!"
   - If 50,000–69,999: "Good effort!"
   - Less than 50,000: "Try to walk more next week."
   
   Create a program that takes 7 daily step counts and displays the total and activity message.

6. **Movie Time Ticket Price**  
   Ticket prices depend on the time of day:

   - Morning (6am–11:59am): 6 EUR
   - Afternoon (12pm–5:59pm): 8 EUR
   - Evening (6pm–11pm): 10 EUR
   
   Ask the user for the movie time (as hour and minute) and display the correct price.

7. **Employee Bonus Calculator**  
   An employee's bonus is based on these rules:

   - Years of service ≥ 5 and rating ≥ 4: Bonus = 1,000 EUR
   - Years of service ≥ 5 and rating < 4: Bonus = 500 EUR
   - Years of service < 5: Bonus = 200 EUR
   
   Create a program that takes years of service and performance rating (1–5) and shows the bonus.

8. **Guess the Secret Number**  
   A secret number between 1 and 20 is stored. The user must guess the number. After each guess, show whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

9. **Multiplication Table Generator**  
   Create a program that asks the user for a number (1–12) and prints the full multiplication table (up to 12) for that number.

10. **Password Strength Checker**  
    The program asks the user to enter a password.

    - If it's **less than 6 characters**: "Too weak"
    - If it's **6–10 characters and includes numbers**: "Moderate"
    - If it's **more than 10 characters and includes both letters and numbers**: "Strong"
    
    Check and display the password strength.

11. **Even or Odd Counter**  
    The program takes **10 numbers** from the user and counts how many are **even** and how many are **odd**, then displays the result.

12. **Fuel Efficiency Checker**  
    A user enters how many **kilometers** they drove and how many **liters** of fuel they used.

    - Efficiency = kilometers / liters
    - If ≥ 20: "High efficiency"
    - Between 10–19: "Average efficiency"
    - Less than 10: "Low efficiency"
    
    Calculate and display the fuel efficiency and category.

13. **Simple Interest Calculator**  
    A person borrows a loan from the bank. The formula for simple interest is:
    
    **Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100**
    
    Example: Principal = 1,000 EUR, Rate = 5%, Time = 2 years
    
    Ask the user for all three values and calculate both the interest and the total amount to repay.

14. **Split the Restaurant Bill**  
    A group of people eats at a restaurant. The total bill is entered, along with the number of people. Calculate and show how much each person should pay.
    
    Example: Bill = 120 EUR, People = 4 → Each pays 30 EUR.

15. **BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator**  
    A person enters their weight in kg and height in meters.
    
    BMI = weight / (height × height)
    
    Based on the BMI value:

    - < 18.5: "Underweight"
    - 18.5–24.9: "Normal"
    - 25–29.9: "Overweight"
    - ≥ 30: "Obese"
    
    Calculate and display the BMI and category.
